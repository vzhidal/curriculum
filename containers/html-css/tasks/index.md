# Practical Tasks

You are to design an HTML/CSS page using PSD mockup(s). The main mockup
contains desktop design. If provided, the second PSD depicts the mobile
version. If not provided, create mobile version based on common sense.
To accomplish that task, you'll need to watch
[several screencasts](https://1drv.ms/f/s!AsZKQfymLyQuhO5NZiCdui5qbY6SLQ)
from HTML/CSS trainings. 


## General Requirements

* You are to design an HTML/CSS page using PSD mockup(s). The main
  mockup contains desktop design. If provided, the second PSD depicts
  the mobile version. If not provided, create mobile version based on
  common sense.
* Don’t use LESS and SASS/SCSS. This task is to focus on HTML and CSS 
  design, not front-end builds and preprocessors.
* Make use of HTML semantic elements. 
* Pay attention to container-content separation while designing HTML and
  CSS structure. It’s briefly described [here](https://github.com/stubbornella/oocss/wiki). 
* Use [BEM methodology](https://ru.bem.info/methodology/) of CSS 
  architecture, but don’t fall for it blindly. 
* Use [BEM’s file structure](https://ru.bem.info/methodology/filestructure/).
  There are several options described, you will have to choose any but
  be ready to justify your choice. 
* The images extracted using Photoshop should be stored in a consistent
  format (JPEG, PNG). The choice of the format should be based on the
  image itself: for example, if it needs transparency, it has to be PNG.
* Use
  [PerfectPixel extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/perfectpixel-by-welldonec/dkaagdgjmgdmbnecmcefdhjekcoceebi?hl=ru)
  for self-checking on how close you are to actual mockups. Bear in mind
  that there are cases when pixel-perfect makeup harms CSS readability
  and reusability. There are cases when it’s better to stick to some
  clear proportions/distances. 
* Though ultimately it may seem to contradict BEM, make use of either
  [normalize.css](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/perfectpixel-by-welldonec/dkaagdgjmgdmbnecmcefdhjekcoceebi?hl=ru)
  or [reset.css](https://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/css/reset/). 
* Use icon fonts for icons. It’s recommended to use some tool to
  generate the CSS that you can add to your page (like
  [icomoon](https://icomoon.io/app/#/select)) rather than use some
  cloud-based solution (e.g. font awesome). 
* GitHub provides a simple static page hosting called
  [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). This is convenient for
  checking so use it. 
* Apply [CSScomb](http://csscomb.com/) tool to lint and order CSS rules.
  The general recommendation of ordering CSS rules can be found
  [here](https://css-tricks.com/poll-results-how-do-you-order-your-css-properties/).
